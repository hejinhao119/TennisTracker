## Key Differences

- **Privacy-first**: Unlike competitors, this system does not upload your videos to the cloud.
- **Cost-effective**: No subscriptions, just open-source tools.
- **Customizable**: You can plug in your own models, experiment with new features, and debug freely.
- **Offline Use**: Great for places without internet access or users who prefer offline systems.


## Future Consideration
- TBD
